This folder contains the results of the python code for simulating Argon using LJ-Potential.
The rc represents cutoff radius. Different folders have different cutoff radius specific results.
LPTT.txt contains values of L_box, Pressure of system, Initial Temperature and Equilibrium Temperature of the system after the simulation.
Time-step = 0.002, Total time = 200 (both dimensionless for all simulations)
